### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `course.py` and `course.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run frontend tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Use `pytest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run backend tests.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components, services, and models in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test API endpoints and component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows (course creation, import, enhancement)
- **Accessibility Tests:** Verify WCAG compliance and screen reader compatibility

## Implementation Summary

The task list has been generated with **63 sub-tasks** across 7 parent tasks:

1. **Database Schema** (8 sub-tasks): Foundation for all data persistence
2. **LRD System** (8 sub-tasks): Core workflow management with approval gates
3. **Content Generation** (10 sub-tasks): All 7 content types with streaming
4. **Import & Enhancement** (8 sub-tasks): File processing and AI enhancement
5. **Version Control** (7 sub-tasks): Full versioning with rollback
6. **Plugin System** (8 sub-tasks): 4 validators and 2 remediators
7. **Frontend UI** (10 sub-tasks): Complete user interface

### Recommended Implementation Order:
1. Start with **1.0 Database Schema** (foundation for everything)
2. Then **7.1-7.2** (basic UI) + **2.0 LRD System** (core workflow)
3. Then **3.0 Content Generation** (primary feature)
4. Then **4.0 Import** + **5.0 Version Control** (enhancement features)
5. Finally **6.0 Plugins** (quality improvements)

### Total Estimated Effort:
- Large tasks: 4 × ~16 hours = 64 hours
- Medium tasks: 3 × ~8 hours = 24 hours
- Total: ~88 hours (11 working days)

**Status**: Task list generation complete. Ready to proceed with Step 3: Implementation.
