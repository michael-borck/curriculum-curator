### 10. User Journey
```
1. Instructor initiates course creation
   ↓
2. System asks: "Do you have an existing unit outline PDF?"
   ├─ Yes → Upload PDF → Parse & Extract → Review & Confirm
   └─ No → Start guided conversation
   ↓
3. Conversational workflow:
   - Define course overview
   - Establish learning outcomes (CLOs)
   - Break down into units (ULOs)
   - Plan weekly schedule
   - Generate content for each week
   ↓
4. Quality assurance:
   - Check alignment matrix
   - Review gap analysis
   - Make adjustments
   ↓
5. Export options:
   - Generate LRD document
   - Create content files
   - Produce instructor guides
```
