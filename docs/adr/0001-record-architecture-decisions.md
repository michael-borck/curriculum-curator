# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-08-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. As the project evolves from a Tauri desktop app to a FastHTML web application, it's important to document why certain choices were made, what alternatives were considered, and what the implications are.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard to document architectural decisions. Each significant decision will be recorded in a separate file in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Future developers (including ourselves) will understand why decisions were made
- Onboarding new team members becomes easier
- We can track the evolution of the architecture over time
- Forces us to think through decisions more carefully

### Negative
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Additional documentation overhead
- May slow down rapid prototyping phases

### Neutral
- ADRs become part of the project repository
- Need to establish a review process for proposed ADRs

## Alternatives Considered

### Wiki Documentation
- External wiki or documentation site
- Rejected because it separates documentation from code

### Code Comments Only
- Document decisions inline with code
- Rejected because it doesn't capture the full context and alternatives

### No Formal Documentation
- Rely on team knowledge and ad-hoc documentation
- Rejected because knowledge is lost when team members leave

## Implementation Notes

- Use the template.md file for consistency
- Number ADRs sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Include ADRs in code reviews
- Link related ADRs to each other
