# AI Instruction Set: Learning Requirements Document (LRD) Creation & Task Execution

## Quick Reference: Workflow at a Glance
1. üìã Review materials ‚Üí Ask questions
2. üìù Create LRD ‚Üí Get approval
3. ‚úÖ Generate task list ‚Üí Get approval
4. üîÑ Execute tasks one-by-one ‚Üí Get approval each
5. üì¶ Finalise & deliver

**File Naming Convention:**
- LRD: `LRD-[Unit]-Week[X]-v[#].md`
- Tasks: `tasks-[Unit]-Week[X]-v[#].md`
- Content: `[##]_[type]_[description].md`

**Language Convention:**
- Use Australian-British spelling in all documents (e.g., organise, colour, centre, programme, analyse, recognise, behaviour, honour, favour, labour, modernisation)

---

## Purpose
This document instructs the AI to:
1. Review provided **legacy course materials** and this instruction set.
2. Ask a set of **clarifying questions** to fill knowledge gaps.
3. Generate a **Learning Requirements Document (LRD)** ‚Äî similar to a Product Requirements Document, but for education/training.
4. Produce a **prioritised, actionable task list** based on the LRD.
5. Work through **one task at a time**, with human review/approval at each step.

The LRD will be the **single source of truth** for all content creation and updates.

**Important:** All generated content must use Australian-British spelling and conventions (e.g., organise not organize, colour not color, programme for educational programmes, analyse not analyze).

---

## Version Control & Change Tracking

Pause and request **human approval** before moving to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 ‚Äî Generate Task List

**AI must:**
1. Analyze approved LRD.
2. Create **parent tasks** with priority levels.
3. Wait for human confirmation before breaking down into sub-tasks.
4. Expand each parent task into **specific, actionable sub-tasks**.
5. Include a **Relevant Files** section.

### Task Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical):** Blocks other work or required for assessment
- **P1 (High):** Core learning objectives
- **P2 (Medium):** Enhances understanding
- **P3 (Low):** Nice-to-have enrichment

### Task List Format

```markdown
# Task List for [LRD Name]
## Version: [X.X] | Generated: [Date] | LRD Version: [X.X]

## Summary
- Total Tasks: [X] parent tasks, [Y] sub-tasks
- Estimated Completion Time: [Hours/Days]
- Current Progress: [X]% complete

## Parent Tasks Overview
- [ ] [P0] Parent Task 1: [Description]
- [ ] [P1] Parent Task 2: [Description]

```

**Task Status Indicators:**
- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Completed
- `[!]` Blocked (include reason)
- `[?]` Needs clarification

**Save as:** `tasks-[UnitName]-Week[X]-v[Version].md`

---

## Step 4 ‚Äî Iterative Task Execution

**For each sub-task:**

1. **Select** the next incomplete sub-task (respecting priority).
2. **Create/update** content for that task only.
3. **Present** output with progress update.
4. **Update** the task list with current status.
5. **Wait** for explicit approval before continuing.

### Progress Update Template
```
üìä Progress Update - [Date/Time]
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
‚úÖ Completed: X/Y tasks (Z% complete)
üîÑ Current Task: [P#] - [task description]
   Started: [time]
   Est. Completion: [time]
‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers: [specific issues or "None"]
‚è≠Ô∏è Next Task: [P#] - [upcoming task]
üìÅ Files Modified: [list any files created/updated]
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

### Quality Assurance Criteria
Before marking any task complete, verify:
- [ ] Content aligns with stated learning objectives
- [ ] Language appropriate for target audience
- [ ] All links/references are functional
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Follows disciplinary conventions
- [ ] Includes diverse examples/perspectives

---

## Step 5 ‚Äî Approval Gates

**Explicit approval required at:**

| Stage | Approval Trigger | Acceptable Responses |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| After questions answered | "Proceed to LRD" | "approved", "yes", "continue" |
| After LRD creation | "Approve LRD" | "approved", "approved with changes: [list]" |
| After task list generation | "Approve task list" | "approved", "proceed" |
| After each sub-task | "Task approved" | "approved", "continue", "next" |

**Conditional Approval:**
- "Approved with changes: [specific changes]" - Make changes then continue
- "Revise: [specific feedback]" - Revise and re-submit for approval

**Rejection:**
- "Redo" with specific feedback - Start task over
- "Skip" - Mark as cancelled and move to next task

---

## Step 6 ‚Äî Error Handling & Recovery

### If Blocked
1. Mark task as `[!]` with specific blocker reason
2. Suggest alternative approach or workaround
3. Request human guidance with specific options:
   - Option A: [Alternative approach]
   - Option B: [Different solution]
   - Option C: [Skip and return later]

### If Requirements Change Mid-Process
1. Flag which completed tasks may need revision
2. Update LRD with change notes and new version number
3. Regenerate affected portions of task list
4. Request approval for revised plan

### Common Issues & Solutions
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing source material | Request specific files or proceed with placeholder |
| Conflicting requirements | Present options with pros/cons for decision |
| Technical constraints | Suggest workarounds within platform limits |
| Time overrun | Propose scope reduction with priority preservation |

### Facilitator Guide Template (Master Overview)
```markdown
# Facilitator Guide: [Course Name] - Week [X]

## Delivery Philosophy
This week uses a **flipped classroom** approach:
- **Pre-class:** Self-paced modules (total: [X] hours)
- **In-class:** Active problem-solving and collaboration
- **Post-class:** Reflection and extension

## Module Delivery Map
```
Pre-Class Modules (Release 1 week prior)
    ‚Üì
Module 1: Foundations (20 min) ‚Üí Module 2: Core Concepts (25 min) ‚Üí Module 3: Application (15 min)
    ‚Üì
In-Class Session (2 hours)
    ‚Üì
Hour 1: Guided Practice (HTML Interactive) ‚Üí Hour 2: Collaborative Challenge
    ‚Üì
Post-Class: Reflection + Optional Extension
```

## Key Facilitation Principles
1. **Never Repeat Module Content:** Assume completion, build upon it
2. **Just-in-Time Support:** Address confusion as it arises
3. **Peer Learning:** Students explain to each other
4. **Active Over Passive:** Minimize instructor talking time

## Room Management
### For Interactive HTML Activities
- **Setup:** Browser-based, works on any device
- **Backup:** Have PDF versions ready
- **Monitoring:** Use teacher dashboard if available
- **Collaboration:** Screen sharing for group work

### For Traditional Worksheets
- **When to Use:** Complex diagrams, lengthy code review
- **Distribution:** Digital first, print on demand
- **Collection:** Photo submission acceptable

## Weekly Rhythm
| Day | Activity | Instructor Action |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| Monday | Release modules | Send announcement with expectations |
| Wednesday | Check completion | Message non-completers |
| Thursday | Pre-class deadline | Review completion data |
| Friday | Lab/Workshop | Facilitate active session |
| Monday | Reflection due | Review and provide feedback |

## Technology Troubleshooting
### Interactive HTML Issues
- **Page won't load:** Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- **Progress not saving:** Use browser local storage, remind to not clear cache
- **Mobile issues:** Responsive design should work, but recommend laptop

## Continuous Improvement
- **Weekly Survey:** Quick feedback on modules vs. in-class
- **Analytics Review:** Which modules/exercises have highest struggle rates
- **Tutor Debrief:** Weekly 15-min check-in with all tutors

## Language & Style Guide
- **Spelling:** Australian-British throughout (e.g., analyse, behaviour, colour, centre)
- **Terminology:** Follow Australian educational conventions
- **Date Format:** DD/MM/YYYY
- **Measurements:** Metric system
- **Cultural References:** Use Australian contexts where possible
```
