# Solving Quadratic Equations

## Today's Skill: Using the Quadratic Formula

### Step 1: Identify the Equation Form
A quadratic equation has the form: ax² + bx + c = 0

Example: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

- c = -3

### Step 2: Apply the Formula
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

### Let's Do One Together
2x² + 5x - 3 = 0

1. Calculate discriminant: b² - 4ac = 25 - 4(2)(-3) = 49
2. Apply formula: x = [-5 ± √49] / 4
3. Solve: x = [-5 ± 7] / 4
4. Find solutions: x = 1/2 or x = -3
